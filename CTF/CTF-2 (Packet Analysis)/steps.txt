i used wireshark tool to be able to trace the packets
then i found that most of the data is encrypted
so any hope will come from an http request
i searched and tried to export any file within the response
i found an encrypted file called %2f containing the flag
i decrypted it usind ROT13 and ROT18
pending which one we will take
i guess ROT18
